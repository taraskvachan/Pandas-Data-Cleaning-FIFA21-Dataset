# Python Pandas Data Cleaning FIFA21 Dataset

## Project Description
This repository contains the code and documentation for the data cleaning process of the FIFA21 dataset. The goal of this project is to clean and enhance the dataset which provides information about players in the popular FIFA21 video game.

## Dataset Source and Overview
The FIFA 21 dataset used in this project was obtained from a data cleaning challenge on Twitter which I was a part of. It consists of player attributes, statistics and other relevant information.
The original FIFA21 dataset contains 18K+ records of player data. Each record represents a unique player and includes various attributes such as player name, age, nationality, club, overall rating and more.

## Issues found in the data
During the initial exploration and analysis of the FIFA21 dataset, several issues were identified including:

Missing values - The Hits and Loan Date End columns had missing values which required careful handling and computation.
Inconsistent formatting - This was observed across different columns making it necessary to standardize the data for consistency. The Heights and Weights columns each had values stored in different units.
